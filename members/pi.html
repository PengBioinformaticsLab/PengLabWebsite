    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
      I am a bioinformatics researcher at the Indiana University School of
      Medicine, where I support interdisciplinary research through the
      development and application of computational methods for large-scale
      biomedical data analysis. I serve as the Director of Bioinformatics at
      the Indiana Center for Musculoskeletal Health and as Co-Director of the
      Collaborative Metabolome Core at the Indiana University School of Medicine.
    </p>

    <p>
      I received my Ph.D. under the mentorship of Dr. Wenyi Wang at the
      MD Anderson Cancer Center and UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical
      Sciences. I completed my postdoctoral training under the supervision of
      Drs. Hongyu Zhao and Curt Scharfe at the Yale School of Public Health and
      Yale School of Medicine. I then continued my research as a research
      faculty member at Yale before joining Indiana University School of
      Medicine in September 2022.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am particularly interested in epigenetic regulation, aging, and
      disease-related molecular signatures. My research experience includes
      DNA methylation analysis, epigenetic clock development, and the analysis
      of high-throughput sequencing data from both bulk and single-cell
      platforms. In addition, I have extensive experience building
      reproducible bioinformatics pipelines and developing data infrastructure
      to support translational and population-level research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through my work, I aim to bridge computational methods and biomedical
      discovery, contributing to collaborative research that advances
      precision medicine and improves human health.
